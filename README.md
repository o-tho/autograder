# autograder v0.1.0

## Automatically grade MCQ exams using optical mark recognition

Autograder allows you to automatically grade MCQ exams. It is written in pure
rust and runs both in the command line and the modern web browsers using wasm.

## Installation

`cargo run help` and `trunk serve` should work just fine. You can see a demo on
[GitHub pages](https://oqpvc.github.io/autograder/). Note that all computations
are done within the browser and no sensitive files will be transmitted anywhere.


## Background

We have previously used
[FormScanner](https://sites.google.com/site/examgrader/formscanner), but
encountered issues in our use case: Java tends to be a pain to set up, using
Excel to grade the exams wasn't convenient for us and it was very difficult to
check for mistakes in the individual grading.

We are supporting the forms generated by FormScanner.

## Idea

You have a bubble sheet like this:

![filledoutform](assets/filled_out_example.png)

You want it automatically graded. `autograder` had a command line interface,
which is self-documented. The following is for the wasm web application.

## Preparation

### The template

We need a template which tells us where every answer box is located on the page
and where three large round circles on the page are to identify the position of
a scan. For this, go to the *Create Template* view. Upload an image file (like .png) of
an empty form, preferably directly converted from a PDF file so nothing is
skewed by a scanner. You need to enter the following information:

- how many questions there are
- how long the student ID is
- how many versions the form has
- how many answers each question has
- how wide an answer bubble is (in px)
- how high an answer bubble is (in px)
- how much padding there is between the bubbles (in px)
- the top-left corner of the first bubble of  the first question (in px)
- the top-left corner of the first bubble of the version question (in px)
- the top-left corner of the first bubble of the first ID question
- the approximate center of the three big circles (in px)
- the approximate radius of the inner white circle (in px)

You should use an image editor like gimp to find out those coordinates.

After entering this data and uploading an image file, you can hit "Preview" so
see if everything goes well. You can then download the configuration to
`template.json`

### The exam key

Go to *Create Key*. Enter how many versions you have and enter the answers. You
can then download the key as `key.json`

## Grading Exams

The most reliable way to scan exams is to use *Multipage Grayscale Tiffs*. PDFs
are also supported, but we have encountered issues with some scanners who
produce invalid JPGs, which we cannot handle. A resolution of 200dpi is sufficient.

Scan to grayscale (and not to "black and white" or binary), because many
scanners use bad algorithms for this.

In the *Generate Report* view you can upload a `template.json`, a `key.json` and
an image container (like a multi-page tiff, a PDF, or a single image).

Once you have uploaded them, you see a button to *Do the thing*. This might take
a moment -- especially unpacking and recoding all images in memory might take a
while. You might also run out of RAM depending on how many images you are trying
to deal with. In that case, split your scans into multiple files and batch
process them.

Afterwards you can download a zip file containing a CSV file with all the
results and conveniently named reports like this ![example report](assets/sample_report.png).
